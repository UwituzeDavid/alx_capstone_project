DevConnect — A GitHub-Powered Developer Directory
Project Idea
DevConnect is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub developers by username, view their profiles, explore their repositories, and bookmark their favorites. It’s designed to be a sleek, responsive, and user-friendly directory for discovering and organizing developer profiles — perfect for recruiters, collaborators, or curious developers.
